It's the New Year.  My coding buddy and I are inspired to get coding & hold each other accountable.  

Inspired by: http://www.100daysofcode.com/

###Old Homework:
- Basic javascript practice because we learned that "everything is an object".  This is good practice for getting back onto the coding bicycle after a holiday vacation.
